This is the first of hopefully many blog posts on my site here.

Iâ€™m hoping to document all of the tech stuff I do on the side on this blog in order to reference it later when I need it, or maybe for someone else to read and learn from.

Anyways I will keep this brief as I am still setting up the site, and just wanted to to a hello world post to kick things off.

{% highlight bash %}
echo "Hello World!"
#=> prints 'Hello World!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
