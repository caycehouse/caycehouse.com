    <p>This is the first of hopefully many blog posts on my site here.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m hoping to document all of the tech stuff I do on the side on this blog in order to reference it later when I need it, or maybe for someone else to read and learn from.</p>

<p>Anyways I will keep this brief as I am still setting up the site, and just wanted to to a hello world post to kick things off.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Hello World!"</span>
<span class="c">#=&gt; prints 'Hello World!' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
